      <p>Jim Henson, an extraordinary artist and visionary, invented unique worlds and characters that remain just as vivid, original and fresh today as when they were created. A television pioneer, an innovator in puppetry, technology and visual arts, and
        a performer who literally brought to life some of the most memorable characters ever-including the world's most famous frog, Kermit™ - Jim Henson's impact on entertainment, education and culture continues to this day.</p>
      <p>Though born in Mississippi, Henson grew up in Hyattsville, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., to which his father, a federal agronomist, had been assigned. As he entered college (the University of Maryland), Henson and his future wife, Jane
        Nebel, created a puppet show on a Washington television station and kept the job throughout their school years, developing the first Muppets (including Kermit) on a five-minute television program called <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sam_and_Friends"
          target="_blank">Sam and Friends</a>. After graduation (A.B., 1960), Henson, along with his assistants, did television commercials and brief spots on various television shows. After the Children’s Television Workshop’s program <a id="tribute-link"
          href="https://pbskids.org/sesame/" target="_blank">Sesame Street</a> began appearing on television in 1969, featuring the Muppets, Henson and his humanoid animals achieved extraordinary nationwide popularity.</p>

      <p>The Muppet Show, which premiered in 1976 and was produced in England, gained an international audience (it was shown in some 100 countries) and was soon followed by the motion pictures The Muppet Movie (1979), The Great Muppet Caper (1981), and
        The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). Henson also codirected The Dark Crystal (1981), directed Labyrinth (1986), and assisted on The Witches (1990), all animated films using puppetlike figures that were not Muppets. In 1981 a Muppets comic strip
        was syndicated. Muppet Magazine, a quarterly publication for children, appeared in 1983–89. Other television ventures featuring the Muppets included Fraggle Rock (1983–87), a puppet show about subterranean creatures, and Jim Henson’s Muppet Babies
        (1984–91), an animated morning cartoon program.</p>

      <p>On May 16, 1990, after a brief illness, Jim Henson died in New York City. With his keen ability for drawing together a strong team of performers, artists, and collaborators who shared his vision and creativity, Jim ensured that his work and unique
        creative vision would continue. Through <a href="https://www.henson.com" target="_blank">The Jim Henson Company</a>, his work continues to captivate and entertain a global audience.</p>
